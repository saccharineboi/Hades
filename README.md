## üîí HADES protocol: E2EE Metaverse

This repository contains the source code, the datasets, and other miscellaneous files used in the
[whitepaper](https://hadesprotocol.org/Hades_E2EE_Metaverse_Protocol_v1_Docs.pdf) and the [preprint](https://hadesprotocol.org/HADES_E2EE_Metaverse_Protocol_Paper.pdf).
This README assumes that you've read at least one of them.

The differences between the whitepaper and the preprint are below:

| Whitepaper <img width="441" height="1">  | Preprint <img width="441" height="1"> |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Uses the names of historical/mythological ancient Greek figures | Uses the more standard Alice/Bob/Eve to refer to the participants of the protocol  |
| Has philosophical sections  | Computer science only |
| Cites scientific and non-scientific sources  | Cites only peer-reviewed scientific sources  |
| More detailed descriptions of the parts of the protocol, e.g. HTF, LPSs, SPSs, etc.  | Succinct descriptions (in general you may think of the preprint as the abridged version of the whitepaper)  |
| Discusses E2EE ancestor simulations  | Doesn't mention [Bostrom's work](https://simulation-argument.com)  |

The datasets are sourced from [Lichess](https://database.lichess.org).

## üî® Building

First, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/saccharineboi/Hades.git
```

After cloning, `cd` in the git directory and create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv .
```

Then install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Before you continue, you must uncompress the files in the `data/` and the `lichess_tensorized/` directories:

```
unxz data/*.xz
unxz lichess_tensorized/*.xz
```

To compile the C files you may use GCC:

```
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -O3 -march=native -s $C_FILE -lm
```

Replace `$C_FILE` with one of the C source files, e.g. `train_legal_illegal.c`.

The C++ files (`ckks-*.cpp`) can be compiled using [CMakeLists.User.txt](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development/blob/main/CMakeLists.User.txt)
provided by the [OpenFHE](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development) library.

Alternatively, you may simply replace the contents of [simple-real-numbers.cpp](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development/blob/main/src/pke/examples/simple-real-numbers.cpp)
with one of `ckks-*.cpp`. In either case, you will need to compile the OpenFHE library with flags `-DWITH_NATIVEOPT=ON` and `-DWITH_TCM=ON`.

## ü§ñ Models

Each model is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with 128 neurons in the input layer, 128 neurons in the hidden layer, and 2 neurons in the output layer.
All models use the logistic function for activations and MSE as the loss function.

- `models/weights-legal-illegal-10M`: binary classifier for legal/illegal chess moves
- `models/weights-mate-nomate-2M`: binary classifier for checkmate/no-checkmate moves
- `models/weights-white-black-checkmates-2M`: binary classifier for white/black checkmates

### weights-legal-illegal-10M

This is a binary classifier trained to classify legal and illegal chess moves (10M stands for 10 million training samples),
also referred to as the `model-alpha` in both the whitepaper and the preprint.
The associated `weights-legal-illegal-log-10M` is a text file containing the training log.
Its accuracy and loss on [lichess databases](https://database.lichess.org/) is show below:

## üìñ Training Datasets

The training samples are generated from `lichess_db_standard_rated_2024-11.pgn`. Following python scripts are used to extract the training samples:

- `gen_legal_and_illegal_moves_lichess.py`: Extracts legal moves from a given database, and modifies some of the extracted legal moves to generate illegal moves
- `gen_mate_and_nomate_moves_lichess.py`: Extracts checkmates and non-checkmate moves from a given database
- `gen_white_and_black_checkmates_lichess.py`: Extracts white and black checkmates from a given database

Their compressed outputs are saved in the `data` directory. You must uncompress them before use.

## üî¨ Testing Datasets

The testing datasets are extracted from lichess databases from January to June of 2013. Following python scripts are used to extract the testing samples:

- `tensorize_lichess_legal_illegal.py`: Extracts legal moves from a given database (does not modify them to generate illegal moves)
- `tensorize_lichess_mate_nomate.py`: Extracts checkmates and non-checkmates from a given database
- `tensorize_lichess_white_black_checkmates.py`: Extracts white and black checkmates from a given database

Their compressed outputs are saved in the `lichess_tensorized` directory. You must decompress them before use.

## üëÅ Renderers

These scripts have been used to generate some of the figures in the papers.

- `render_piece.py`: Renders a chess piece given its symbol
- `render_board.py`: Renders a chess board given its position as a [FEN string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation)
- `graph.py`: Produces a graph from a given training log (e.g. `weights-legal-illegal-log-10M`)
- `KV.py`: Visualizes the predictions made by the models

The white pieces generated by `render_piece.py` are:

<img src="/assets/white_pawn.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block;"> <img src="/assets/white_rook.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/white_knight.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/white_bishop.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/white_queen.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/white_king.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;">

And the black pieces:

<img src="/assets/black_pawn.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block;"> <img src="/assets/black_rook.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/black_knight.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/black_bishop.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/black_queen.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/black_king.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;">

`render_board.py` generates an image of a chess board given its FEN string representation.
E.g. the string 'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R' corresponds to the image below:

![Generated chess board](/assets/example_board.png)

`KV.py` visualizes the predictions made by the models, e.g. the below
figure shows `model-alpha`'s predictions for the white knight on G1,
correctly predicting the legal squares that the knight can move to.

![Visualization of one of the predictions made by KV.py](/assets/example_pred_vis.png)

The meanings of the colors depend on the model:

- `model-alpha`: Greener values indicate higher confidence in move's legality, redder values indicate higher confidence in move's illegality
- `model-beta`: Greener values indicate higher confidence in move resulting in a checkmate, redder values indicate higher confidence in move not resulting in a checkmate (note that `model-beta` assumes that the move is legal)
- `model-gamma`: Greener values indicate higher confidence in move being a checkmate by white, redder values indicate higher confidence in move being a checkmate by black (note that `model-gamma` assumes that the move is legal and results in a checkmate)

## üîí Private Inference via CKKS

The source files below are used to test inference on encrypted input via FHE (namely, the [RNS version of the CKKS scheme](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-10970-7_16)):

- `ckks-legal-illegal.cpp`: Runs private inference for `model-alpha`
- `ckks-mate-nomate.cpp`: Runs private inference for `model-beta`
- `ckks-white-black-checkmates.cpp`: Runs private inference for `model-gamma`

They are all modified versions of the same [source file](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development/blob/main/src/pke/examples/simple-real-numbers.cpp)
in the examples directory of the [OpenFHE](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development) library and carry the original license.
