## üîí Hades Protocol

This repository contains the source code, scripts, and the datasets used in [E2EE Metaverse](https://hadesprotocol.org/whitepaper.pdf).

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction

The purpose of the Hades protocol is two-fold:

1. Improve the privacy of the users in [Metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse),
2. Improve the interoperability between the different implementations of the protocol.

It achieves the above via the methods outlined below:

1. Establish an end-to-end encrypted tunnel between every user, via ***Local Programmable States***,
2. Enable adversarial machines to perform computations on encrypted data, via ***Shared Programmable States***,
3. Introduce a standardized format to store and exchange 3D data, via ***Hadean Transmission Format***.

For an in-depth discussion of the methods see the [whitepaper](https://hadesprotocol.org/whitepaper.pdf).
Below are the models, the datasets, and various source files used/mentioned in the paper:

## ü§ñ Models

Each model is a multi-layer perceptron with 128 neurons in the input layer, 128 neurons in the hidden layer, and 2 neurons in the output layer.
All models use the logistic function for activations and MSE as the loss function.

- `models/weights-legal-illegal-10M`: binary classifier for legal/illegal chess moves
- `models/weights-mate-nomate-2M`: binary classifier for checkmate/no-checkmate moves
- `models/weights-white-black-checkmates-2M`: binary classifier for white/black checkmates

### weights-legal-illegal-10M

This is a binary classifier trained to classify legal and illegal chess moves (10M stands for 10 million training samples),
also referred to as the `model-alpha` in the [whitepaper](https://hadesprotocol.org/whitepaper.pdf).
The associated `weights-legal-illegal-log-10M` is a text file containing the training log.
Its accuracy and loss on [lichess databases](https://database.lichess.org/) is show below:

| Database                               | Accuracy    | Loss     |

## üìñ Training Datasets

The training samples are from `lichess_db_standard_rated_2024-11.pgn`. Following python files are used to extract the training samples:

- `gen_legal_and_illegal_moves_lichess.py`: Extracts legal moves from a given database, and modifies some of the extracted legal moves to generate illegal moves
- `gen_mate_and_nomate_moves_lichess.py`: Extracts checkmates and non-checkmate moves from a given database
- `gen_white_and_black_checkmates_lichess.py`: Extracts white and black checkmates from a given database

Their compressed outputs are saved in the `data` directory. You must decompress them before use.

## üî¨ Testing Datasets

The testing datasets are extracted from lichess databases from January to June of 2013. Following python files are used to extract the testing samples:

- `tensorize_lichess_legal_illegal.py`: Extracts legal moves from a given database (does not modify them to generate illegal moves)
- `tensorize_lichess_mate_nomate.py`: Extracts checkmates and non-checkmates from a given database
- `tensorize_lichess_white_black_checkmates.py`: Extracts white and black checkmates from a given database

Their compressed outputs are saved in the `lichess_tensorized` directory. You must decompress them before use.

## üëÅ Renderers

These scripts have been used to generate some of the images in the [whitepaper](https://hadesprotocol.org/whitepaper.pdf).

- `render_piece.py`: Renders a chess piece given its symbol
- `render_board.py`: Renders a chess board given its position as a [FEN string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth%E2%80%93Edwards_Notation)
- `graph.py`: Produces a graph from a given training log (e.g. `weights-legal-illegal-log-10M`)

The white pieces generated by `render_piece.py` are:

<img src="/assets/white_pawn.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block;"> <img src="/assets/white_rook.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/white_knight.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/white_bishop.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/white_queen.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/white_king.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;">

And the black pieces:

<img src="/assets/black_pawn.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block;"> <img src="/assets/black_rook.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/black_knight.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/black_bishop.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/black_queen.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;"> <img src="/assets/black_king.png" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; display: inline-block; margin-left: 10px;">

`render_board.py` generates an image of a chess board given its FEN string representation.
E.g. the string 'r1bqkbnr/pp1p1ppp/2n1p3/2p5/3P1B2/5N2/PPP1PPPP/RN1QKB1R' corresponds to the image below:

## üîí Private Inference via CKKS

The source files below are used to test inference on encrypted input:

- `ckks-legal-illegal.cpp`: Runs private inference for `model-alpha`
- `ckks-mate-nomate.cpp`: Runs private inference for `model-beta`
- `ckks-white-black-checkmates.cpp`: Runs private inference for `model-gamma`

They are all modified versions of the same [source file](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development/blob/main/src/pke/examples/simple-real-numbers.cpp)
in the examples directory of the [OpenFHE](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development) library and carry the original license.

## üî® Building

After cloning, `cd` in the git directory and create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv .
```

Then install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The C files (`train_*.c` and `test_*.c`) can be compiled with `gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -O3 -march=native -s $FILE.c -o $FILE -lm`,
they have no dependencies, other than the standard library.

The C++ files (`ckks-*.cpp`) can be compiled using [CMakeLists.User.txt](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development/blob/main/CMakeLists.User.txt)
provided by the [OpenFHE](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-development) library.
